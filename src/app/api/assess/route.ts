- Conclusion: most obvious result, reference to previous research; restatement of the aim; solutions/recommendations

Coherence and Cohesion:
- Logical organization of information and ideas
- Cohesive devices (conjunctions and linkers)
- Paragraphing

Grammatical Range and Accuracy:
- Functions: cause/effect, compare/contrast, prediction, recommendation/suggestion/solution
- Grammar structures
- Punctuation

Lexical Resource:
- Vocabulary range and genre-specific register
- Spelling and/or word formation and capitalization

============================================================
SCORING AND FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL — FOLLOW EXACTLY):
============================================================

STEP 1 — SCORE each criterion using WHOLE or HALF numbers (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5). If the text's quality falls between two adjacent score bands, award a half-point (e.g., 3.5). Use 0.5 increments only — never use 0.25 or 0.75.

STEP 2 — For EACH criterion, write a "Justification" paragraph that:
  (a) Explicitly names the score band you chose (e.g. "Score 3.5 — Satisfactory")
  (b) Quotes at least ONE specific phrase or sentence from the student's text as evidence
  (c) Explains why the text fits that band descriptor — connect the evidence to the rubric
  (d) If you awarded a half-point, explain which aspects place it in the lower band and which in the higher band
  (e) If the score is below 4, clearly state what is missing compared to the next higher band
  (f) If the score is 5, explain what the student did beyond expectations

STEP 3 — For each criterion, list SPECIFIC errors found in the text. Format each as:
  - "[exact quoted text]" — highlight the mistake and explain why it is wrong, but do NOT provide the corrected version

STEP 4 — For each criterion, provide 1-2 concrete, achievable suggestions for improvement appropriate for an A2-B1 level writer.

STEP 5 — overallFeedback must be a comprehensive summary (4-6 sentences) that:
  - Highlights the student's strongest criterion and what they did well
  - Identifies the weakest area needing the most attention
  - Evaluates whether the Discussion section effectively analyzes and interprets the data
  - Evaluates whether the Conclusion section adequately summarizes results and provides recommendations
  - Gives one prioritized action item to focus on next

STEP 6 — Calculate totalScore = sum of all criterion scores (max ${totalMaxScore}). Calculate percentage = round(totalScore / ${totalMaxScore} * 100).

============================================================
CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Respond with ONLY the raw JSON object. No markdown, no code fences, no commentary.
- Do NOT wrap the JSON in triple-backtick code blocks.
- Use straight double quotes, not smart/curly quotes.
- Do NOT add trailing commas after the last item in arrays or objects.
- All string values must have properly escaped quotes inside them.
- FORMAT: Write justification, strengths, suggestions, and overallFeedback using bullet points (•) or numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) wherever possible. Each bullet should be a separate, clear point. This makes the report easier to read for students.

============================================================
SCORING AND FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL — FOLLOW EXACTLY):
============================================================

STEP 1 — SCORE each criterion using WHOLE or HALF numbers (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, or 6). If the essay's quality falls between two adjacent score bands, award a half-point (e.g., 3.5). Use 0.5 increments only — never use 0.25 or 0.75.

STEP 2 — For EACH criterion, write a "Justification" paragraph that:
  (a) Explicitly names the score band you chose (e.g. "Score 3.5" meaning between Satisfactory and Good)
  (b) Quotes at least ONE specific phrase or sentence from the student's essay as evidence
  (c) Explains why the essay fits that band descriptor — connect the evidence to the rubric
  (d) If you awarded a half-point, explain which aspects place it in the lower band and which aspects place it in the higher band
  (e) If the score is below 4, clearly state what is missing compared to the next higher band
  (f) If the score is 5 or 6, explain what the student did beyond expectations

This justification must make the score transparent and defensible. A reader should understand exactly why that score was given based on the evidence.

STEP 3 — For each criterion, list SPECIFIC errors found in the text. Format each as:
  - "[exact quoted text]" — highlight the mistake and explain why it is wrong, but do NOT provide the corrected version

STEP 4 — For each criterion, provide 1-2 concrete, achievable suggestions for improvement appropriate for an A1-A2 learner.

STEP 5 — overallFeedback must be a comprehensive summary (3-5 sentences) that:
  - Highlights the student's strongest criterion and what they did well
  - Identifies the weakest area needing the most attention
  - Gives one prioritized action item to focus on next

STEP 6 — Calculate totalScore = sum of all criterion scores (max 24). Scores may include 0.5 increments (e.g., 3.5, 4.5). Calculate percentage = round(totalScore / 24 * 100).

SUMMARY WRITING ASSESSMENT RUBRICS (LANC2160 — Summary Writing):

${criteriaDetails}

SUMMARY-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT RULES:
1. A summary must capture the MAIN IDEAS of the source text — focus on key points, not minor details.
2. The student must use their OWN WORDS (paraphrasing). Direct copying of phrases or sentences from the source text without paraphrasing indicates poor summarizing skills and should lower the Task Achievement and Lexical Resource scores.
3. A summary should NOT include the student's personal opinions, arguments, or new information not present in the source text.
4. The summary should be approximately one-third of the original text length. Significantly shorter summaries likely miss key points; significantly longer ones likely include unnecessary details.
5. If the summary is off-topic (not about the source text at all), give Task Achievement = 0.
6. If the student has simply copied large portions of the source text, this is NOT an acceptable summary — it should score low on Task Achievement and Lexical Resource regardless of how "accurate" the text is.

============================================================
SCORING AND FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL — FOLLOW EXACTLY):
============================================================

STEP 1 — SCORE each criterion using WHOLE or HALF numbers (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5). Use 0.5 increments only — never use 0.25 or 0.75. If the summary's quality falls between two adjacent score bands, award a half-point (e.g., 3.5).

STEP 2 — For EACH criterion, write a "Justification" paragraph that:
  (a) Explicitly names the score band you chose (e.g. "Score 3.5 — Good achievement")
  (b) Quotes at least ONE specific phrase or sentence from the student's summary as evidence
  (c) Explains why the summary fits that band descriptor — connect the evidence to the rubric
  (d) If you awarded a half-point, explain which aspects place it in the lower band and which aspects place it in the higher band
  (e) For Task Achievement: specifically address how many main ideas from the source text were captured, whether paraphrasing was used, and whether irrelevant details were excluded
  (f) If the score is below 3, clearly state what is missing compared to a higher score
  (g) If the score is 4 or 5, explain what the student did beyond basic expectations

STEP 3 — For each criterion, list SPECIFIC errors found in the text. Format each as:
  - "[exact quoted text]" — highlight the mistake and explain why it is wrong, but do NOT provide the corrected version

STEP 4 — For each criterion, provide 1-2 concrete, achievable suggestions for improvement appropriate for an A2-B1 learner. For example: "Try using linking words like 'Furthermore' or 'In addition' to connect your ideas."

STEP 5 — overallFeedback must be a comprehensive summary (4-6 sentences) that:
  - Identifies which main ideas from the source text the student captured and which ones were missing
  - Highlights the student's strongest criterion and what they did well
  - Identifies the weakest area needing the most attention
  - Comments on the paraphrasing quality (own words vs. copied text)
  - Gives one prioritized action item to focus on next

STEP 6 — Calculate totalScore = sum of all criterion scores (max ${totalMaxScore}). Scores may include 0.5 increments (e.g., 3.5, 4.5). Calculate percentage = round(totalScore / ${totalMaxScore} * 100).

============================================================
SCORING AND FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL — FOLLOW EXACTLY):
============================================================

STEP 1 — SCORE each criterion using WHOLE or HALF numbers (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5). If the essay's quality falls between two adjacent score bands, award a half-point (e.g., 3.5). Use 0.5 increments only — never use 0.25 or 0.75.

STEP 2 — For EACH criterion, write a "Justification" paragraph that:
  (a) Explicitly names the score band you chose (e.g. "Score 3.5 — Satisfactory")
  (b) Quotes at least ONE specific phrase or sentence from the student's essay as evidence
  (c) Explains why the essay fits that band descriptor — connect the evidence to the rubric
  (d) If you awarded a half-point, explain which aspects place it in the lower band and which in the higher band
  (e) If the score is below 4, clearly state what is missing compared to the next higher band
  (f) If the score is 5, explain what the student did beyond expectations

STEP 3 — For each criterion, list SPECIFIC errors found in the text. Format each as:
  - "[exact quoted text]" — highlight the mistake and explain why it is wrong, but do NOT provide the corrected version

STEP 4 — For each criterion, provide 1-2 concrete, achievable suggestions for improvement appropriate for an A2-B1 level writer.

STEP 5 — overallFeedback must be a comprehensive summary (4-6 sentences) that:
  - Highlights the student's strongest criterion and what they did well
  - Identifies the weakest area needing the most attention
  - Evaluates how well the essay addresses the assigned discussion points
  - Evaluates how effectively the student used the source text (paraphrasing vs copying)
  - Gives one prioritized action item to focus on next

STEP 6 — Calculate totalScore = sum of all criterion scores (max ${totalMaxScore}). Calculate percentage = round(totalScore / ${totalMaxScore} * 100).

  return `You are an expert writing assessor evaluating a Credit level student's synthesis essay for Sultan Qaboos University's Center for Preparatory Studies, course LANC2160 (Academic English: Summary Writing & Synthesis Essay).

STUDENT LEVEL: CEFR A2-B1 (Elementary to Pre-Intermediate). Feedback must use simple, clear language that A2-B1 learners can understand. Be encouraging while maintaining appropriate academic standards. Avoid overly technical linguistic terminology.

TASK: The student was asked to read ALL THREE source texts below and write a 4-paragraph synthesis essay (${targetWordCount.min}-${targetWordCount.max} words) based on the assignment below.

ASSIGNMENT: ${assignmentTitle}
INSTRUCTIONS: ${assignmentDescription}

${sourceTextsBlock}

${wordCountStatus}
Target essay length: ${targetWordCount.min}-${targetWordCount.max} words (ideal: ${targetWordCount.ideal} words).

SYNTHESIS ESSAY ASSESSMENT RUBRICS (LANC2160 — Two-Point Essay Writing Marking Criteria):

${criteriaDetails}

SYNTHESIS-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT RULES:
1. A synthesis essay must combine information from ALL THREE source texts — not just one or two. The student should demonstrate the ability to integrate ideas from multiple sources into a coherent whole.
2. The essay must address the specific assignment prompt: "${assignmentTitle}". The essay should cover the key points required by the prompt, drawing evidence from all three sources.
3. The essay should be exactly 4 paragraphs in structure (typically: introduction, body paragraph 1, body paragraph 2, and conclusion). If the student has written significantly more or fewer paragraphs, note this in the Coherence and Cohesion assessment.
4. The student MUST use their OWN WORDS (paraphrasing). Direct copying of phrases or sentences from the source texts without paraphrasing is NOT acceptable and must lower the Task Achievement and Lexical Resource scores. Estimate the percentage of directly copied text.
5. A synthesis essay should NOT include the student's personal opinions, arguments, or new information not present in the source texts.
6. If the essay is off-topic (not addressing the assignment prompt), give Task Achievement = 0.
7. If the student has simply copied large portions of any source text, this is NOT an acceptable synthesis — it should score low on Task Achievement and Lexical Resource regardless of how "accurate" the text is.
8. Check word count: if the word count is 10% or more above or below the target range, this MUST lower the Task Achievement score according to the rubric bands.

============================================================
SCORING AND FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL — FOLLOW EXACTLY):
============================================================

STEP 1 — SCORE each criterion using WHOLE or HALF numbers (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5). Use 0.5 increments only — never use 0.25 or 0.75. If the essay's quality falls between two adjacent score bands, award a half-point (e.g., 3.5).

STEP 2 — For EACH criterion, write a "Justification" paragraph that:
  (a) Explicitly names the score band you chose (e.g. "Score 3.5 — between Satisfactory and Good")
  (b) Quotes at least ONE specific phrase or sentence from the student's essay as evidence
  (c) Explains why the essay fits that band descriptor — connect the evidence to the rubric
  (d) If you awarded a half-point, explain which aspects place it in the lower band and which aspects place it in the higher band
  (e) For Task Achievement: specifically address whether the student synthesized ALL THREE sources, addressed the assignment prompt requirements, stayed within word count, and used own words
  (f) If the score is below 3, clearly state what is missing compared to a higher score
  (g) If the score is 4 or 5, explain what the student did beyond basic expectations

STEP 3 — For each criterion, list SPECIFIC errors found in the text. Format each as:
  - "[exact quoted text]" — highlight the mistake and explain why it is wrong, but do NOT provide the corrected version

STEP 4 — For each criterion, provide 1-2 concrete, achievable suggestions for improvement appropriate for an A2-B1 learner. For example: "Try using linking words like 'Furthermore' or 'In addition' to connect your ideas."

STEP 5 — overallFeedback must be a comprehensive summary (4-6 sentences) that:
  - Identifies which sources the student used and whether all three were synthesized
  - Highlights the student's strongest criterion and what they did well
  - Identifies the weakest area needing the most attention
  - Comments on the paraphrasing quality (own words vs. copied text) and estimated copying percentage
  - Gives one prioritized action item to focus on next

STEP 6 — Calculate totalScore = sum of all criterion scores (max ${totalMaxScore}). Scores may include 0.5 increments (e.g., 3.5, 4.5). Calculate percentage = round(totalScore / ${totalMaxScore} * 100).

============================================================
CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Respond with ONLY the raw JSON object. No markdown, no code fences, no commentary.
- Do NOT wrap the JSON in triple-backtick code blocks.
- Use straight double quotes, not smart/curly quotes.
- Do NOT add trailing commas after the last item in arrays or objects.
- All string values must have properly escaped quotes inside them.
- FORMAT: Write justification, strengths, suggestions, and overallFeedback using bullet points (•) or numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) wherever possible. Each bullet should be a separate, clear point. This makes the report easier to read for students.
