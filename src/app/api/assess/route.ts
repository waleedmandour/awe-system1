BAND CALIBRATION FOR CEFR A2-B1 (what each band looks like at this level):
- 4.5-5/5 (Excellent): Exceptional for A2-B1. Approaches B1+ level. Very rare.
- 4/5 (Good): Strong for A2-B1. Clear communication with minor expected errors.
- 3-3.5/5 (Satisfactory): Average for A2-B1. Meaning usually clear despite grammar/vocabulary errors. Most credit students score here.
- 2-2.5/5 (Unsatisfactory): Below expectations even for A2-B1. Frequent errors impede understanding.
- 0-1.5/5 (Poor): Incomprehensible, completely off-task, or large-scale copying. Reserve for genuine failures.

ERROR CLASSIFICATION (apply per criterion — this is critical):
1. Expected A2/B1 errors (missing articles a/an/the, wrong prepositions in/on/at, subject-verb agreement for 3rd person singular, awkward paraphrasing from sources, limited sentence variety, minor spelling) → Do NOT lower the score. These are normal developmental errors at this level.
2. Non-impeding errors (meaning still clear; repetitive vocabulary, minor punctuation, occasional awkward phrasing) → Only minor score impact if frequent.
3. Impeding errors (reader cannot understand; wrong text type; large-scale copying without paraphrasing; task fundamentally not met) → Significant score impact.
Rate each criterion based primarily on COMMUNICATION SUCCESS and IMPEDING errors, not total error count.

SPECIAL RULES:
1. Reward successful communication of ideas. Do not be overly harsh on A2/B1 grammatical/spelling errors if the overall meaning is clear.
2. For error listings: classify each error as expected, non-impeding, or impeding. Do NOT provide corrections.

SCORING FLOW (follow in this order):
Step 1 — Identify what the student communicated successfully (strengths first).
Step 2 — Determine the overall CEFR demonstrated level.
Step 3 — Score each criterion 0-5 (0.5 increments) relative to A2-B1 expectations, not B2+ standards.
Step 4 — Only deduct for errors that genuinely impede meaning or show a gap below A2 level.

ASSESSMENT RUBRICS (FP0230 and FP0340):
${buildCriteriaText(rubrics)}

BAND CALIBRATION FOR CEFR A1-A2 (what each band looks like at this level):
- 5-6/6 (Excellent): Exceptional for A1-A2. Near-fluent grammar, rich vocabulary, perfect structure. Very rare at this level.
- 4-4.5/6 (Good): Strong for A1-A2. Clear communication with minor expected errors. This is the typical range for strong foundation students.
- 3-3.5/6 (Satisfactory): Average for A1-A2. Meaning is usually clear despite frequent grammar/vocabulary errors. Most foundation students score here.
- 2-2.5/6 (Weak): Below expectations even for A1-A2. Meaning often unclear, very limited vocabulary or severe structural issues.
- 0-1.5/6 (Very Poor): Incomprehensible or completely off-topic. Reserve for genuine failures to communicate.

ERROR CLASSIFICATION (apply per criterion — this is critical):
1. Expected A1/A2 errors (e.g., missing articles, wrong preposition, subject-verb agreement for 3rd person singular, incorrect word order in complex sentences) → Do NOT lower the score. These are normal developmental errors at this level.
2. Non-impeding errors (meaning is still clear despite the error; e.g., wrong tense form, spelling that does not obscure meaning) → Only minor score impact if the error is frequent.
3. Impeding errors (reader genuinely cannot understand the intended meaning) → Significant score impact.
Rate each criterion based primarily on COMMUNICATION SUCCESS and IMPEDING errors, not total error count.

SPECIAL RULES:
1. Deduct marks for Task Response ONLY IF the text is severely off-topic. Do not penalize minor tangents.
2. Reward successful communication of ideas. Do not be overly harsh on minor A1/A2 grammatical/spelling errors if the overall meaning is clear.

SCORING FLOW (follow in this order):
Step 1 — Identify what the student communicated successfully (strengths first).
Step 2 — Determine the overall CEFR demonstrated level from the essay.
Step 3 — Score each criterion 0-6 (0.5 increments) relative to A1-A2 expectations, not B2+ academic standards.
Step 4 — Only deduct for errors that genuinely impede meaning or show a gap below A1 level.
Step 5 — For each criterion: quote at least ONE exact phrase from the essay as evidence in your justification.
Step 6 — List up to 3 specific errors per criterion as { "quote": "[exact text]", "explanation": "[why wrong]" }. Classify each as expected, non-impeding, or impeding. Do NOT provide corrections.
Step 7 — Write 1-2 specific strengths and 1-2 actionable suggestions per criterion.
Step 8 — overallFeedback (3-4 sentences): strongest/weakest criterion, what the student communicated well, one prioritized action item.
Step 9 — For Task Response: address topic adherence and essay structure. If the word count exceeds the target, mention it but do NOT deduct marks.
Step 10 — Do NOT calculate totalScore or percentage — those are computed automatically.`;
